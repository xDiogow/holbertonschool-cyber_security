# CVE-2017-0144 (MS17-010) Vulnerability Research

## CVE ID
CVE-2017-0144

## Detailed Description
The vulnerability affects the Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1) protocol in Windows. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system without authentication due to improper validation of SMB packets. This vulnerability was famously exploited by the **WannaCry** ransomware to propagate automatically between vulnerable systems.

## CVSS Score
- **CVSS v3**: 8.1 (High)
- **Attack Vector**: AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (Remote access, no user interaction required).

## Potential Impacts
- **Confidentiality**: High risk, as it allows complete access.
- **Integrity**: Data can be modified or corrupted.
- **Availability**: Systems may become unusable, as seen in the WannaCry ransomware attack that encrypted files and locked users out.

## Mitigations and Patches
Microsoft released a patch in March 2017 to address this vulnerability on affected systems, including older versions like Windows XP. Disabling SMBv1 is recommended if not required, and keeping systems updated is essential to prevent exploitation.
